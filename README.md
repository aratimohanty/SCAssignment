https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

The flow of the application is:

1.) The launch screen displays a list of breeds for the user to select from. The list is searchable for better user experience.
2.)Once the user selects a breed, the next view displays him an image of that breed and a list of sub-breeds for that breed(if any) which can again be selected to see details of the sub-breed.
3.)Saved the image in local cache so that if the same breed is selected again the image can be shown from the cache itself.
4.)The user can go back to the listing page to change his selection.
5.)Added Unit test for uitableview and view controller cases.
